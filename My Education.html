<h1 style="color: brown; text-align: center;">My Education</h1>
<p>I currently school at the University of Windsor but I have been at 4 schools before I joined this one.</p>
<p>The first school I went to was Greensprings in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria. Then, from year 7 - year 9, I was in Lifeforte boarding school in Ibadan, Nigeria</p>
<p>From years 9 - 11, I was in Meadow hall school, Lekki, Lagos and the final school I attented before this one was the Great Lakes College of Toronto.</p>
<h2 style="color: brown;"><b>In the University of Windsor I am currently taking 5 courses, they are: </b></h2>
<p><b>Data Structures</b>: A course about how to improve algorithms and/or make code more efficient.</p>
<p><b>Object Oriented programming in Java</b>: This course is teaching us how to code with Java; explaining concepts like classes, java import functions etc.</p>
<p><b>Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science</b>: Teaches us how to prove mathematical theorems with formal proofs, truth tables and other proof methods.</p>
<p><b>Computer Architecture</b>: This course is teaching us how to work in different bases and number systems.</p>
<p><b>Introduction to the internet</b>: Final course teaching us how to code in html and how to protect ourselves from the dangers of the internet.</p>
<p>Overall, computer science is quite a hard course but I believe this is all worth it as it will help me achieve my very important goals.</p>
