<h1 style="text-align: center; color: brown;">Things I Like</h1>
<p> I dont have a lot of time now that i am in university but in my spare time what I enjoy doing several things. Firstly, I love playing video games even though they can be very distracting. I try not to spend so much time on it as I used to for obvious reasons but I still really enjoy it whenever I get the chance.</p>

<p>I also really enjoy playing the guitar. I have been playing for almost 6 years and although I have stayed away from it recently I still feel elated whenever I play.</p>

<p>Music is probably what I do most of the time. I cannot go a single day without listening to at least one song. I believe this is God's gift to the world.
